            <p>Post-Records is a completely fictional record store. This site is a project page to showcase Gian Carlos' skillset as a front-end web developer and designer. You are not actually purchasing these records at these prices. The inventory listed however are part of my real life record collection. I may consider crazy offers!</p>
